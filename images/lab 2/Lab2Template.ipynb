In my particular graph, I am showing how far the data varies above and below the overall averge of 4,938 for each year. As you can tell from one quick glance, each year's bar either points upwards(exceeding the average) or downwards(below the average). This format makes it easy to separate which years are the underperforming years and which years are exceeding the average. "

In my example, I chose two variables(# of overtimes and win points) for each year and compared them side by side to see if there was any correlation for the years. As we can see, the winning points year by year have a positive correlation, but not very strong. The # of overtimes year by year have a much weaker correlation because the points are more spread out and not grouped in a compact upward or downward sloping line. "

        "A ranking graph simply shows which group scores highest or lowest in a certain category. It is ranked by least to greatest or vice versa so that viewers can easily see which group is the highest or lowest ranking. This is great for comparing groups. I am comparing which year had the highest win seed (2014) and the lowest winning seed (2007). If someone wanted to know the top 5 highest winning seed years, they could easily see the top 5 bars on my graph which would rank (2014, 2013, 2011, 2016, 2012). It is intresting to see that the top 5 years are all very close so we could infer about why the team from 2011-2016 was so much better than previous years. Better coaching staff? Better players? "

The \"whiskers\" show the minimum and maximum values, Q1-Q3 within the gray box shows the interquartile range. Q2 is important because it highlights the median of the data. The data is broken up in to 25% chunks- (minimum - Q1 = 25%), (Q1 - Q2 = 25%), (Q2 - Q3 = 25%), (Q3 - maximun = 25%). Box and whisker plots give so much information with their shape. Here I am showing the spread of losing points year by year. The medians vary by seeing the gray portion of the box move slightly year by year, and the maximum losing points can easily be spotted with the range of the top \"whisker\"."

Here we can see how the total number of overtimes in a year changes from 2000- 2017. 2012-2013 are the lowest point on the graph which shows a major dip in the amount of overtimes in games played that year. Positive and negative trends are easily spotted with the upward or downward slope of the line year by year."
